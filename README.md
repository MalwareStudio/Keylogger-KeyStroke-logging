# **Keylogger/KeyStroke-logging**
Keylogger is a type of software, that is used for tracking keystrokes. It doesn't always have to be used for malicious purposes. For instance, the tracking can be used for analyzing and improving search engines based on what people search on a day-to-day basis. Some companies use keyloggers to make sure that employees do their work correctly.

When it comes to malicious keylogger, simply put keylogger malware then we usually talk about sending information to someone else without the user's knowledge. This information is typically used for breaking into some device, system or just spying for other reasons...
## **Description**
I created a basic Keylogger in [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/) with [WIN API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/apiindex/windows-api-list).

After launch, the keylogger throw fake error message and then it set itself as a startup application. Later on it write kdata.txt where every keystore will be stored.
Then it just do its thing repeatedly until the user Log Out.

Keep in mind that other keyloggers usually send the informatio to attacker via network. In this case, it's not doing that. This keylogger is offline which means, nothing bad can happen :)
