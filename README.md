# **Keylogger/KeyStroke-logging**
Keylogger is a type of software, that is used for tracking keystrokes. It doesn't always have to be used for malicious purposes. For instance, the tracking can be used for analyzing and improving search engines based on what people search on a day-to-day basis. Some companies use keyloggers to make sure that employees do their work correctly.

When it comes to malicious keylogger, simply put keylogger malware then we usually talk about sending information to someone else without the user's knowledge. This information is typically used for breaking into some device, system or just spying for other reasons...
